# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Project Overview
This analysis was done to attempt to build machine learning to accurately predict Credit Risk based off of several factors. The provided data was split into training and testing groups before being put through 6 different machine learning models.

## Project Results
- Random Oversampling had a 65.7% Accuracy score, High Risk Precision at 1%, and a 69% Recall score.
- Smote Oversampling scored a 64.7% accuracy score, a 1% precision score for High Risk, and 61% Recall. 
- Undersampling scored a 64.7% accuracy and 1% high risk precision, with a 69% Recall score
- Combination scored a 64.4% Accuracy score and a 1% High Risk precision, with 72% Recall.
- Random Forest Classifier scored a 78.8% accuracy score, a .03 Precision score, and a 70% Recall score for high risk.
- Easy ADA Booster scored a 93.1% accuracy score and a 9% Precision score for high risk and a 92% Recall score.

## Summary
The two ensemble scores show that their models were more accurate at predicting credit risk than the 4 sampling scores. A mix of both models may give the best opportunity to have accurate predictions.
